This project is focused on setting up a reproducible Python environment. The purpose is to create a clean, organized workspace so that future data analysis and modeling can be performed consistently and transparently. By structuring the repository with `data/`, `src/`, and `notebooks/`, configuring secrets through a `.env` file, and verifying functionality with Jupyter and NumPy, we can ensure the project is well-prepared for collaborative development and future scaling.
