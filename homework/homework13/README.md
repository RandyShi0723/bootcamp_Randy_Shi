# Project README

- **Project Overview and Objectives**
  - This project builds and evaluates model designed to provide accurate forecasts.
  - The primary objective is to assess model robustness and communicate potential risks to stakeholders clearly and concisely.
  - The dataset includes multiple demographic and behavioral features, cleaned and preprocessed to minimize missingness and outlier impact.
  - Deliverables include model performance metrics (RMSE, R²), sensitivity analyses, and recommendations for ongoing monitoring and recalibration.

- **How to Rerun Scripts/Notebooks**
  - **Requirements:**  
    - Python 
    - Core libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `jupyter`

- **Assumptions, Risks, and Lifecycle Mapping**
  - **Key Assumptions:**
    - Data distributions remain consistent with the training dataset.
    - Predictors are stable over time, with minimal missingness or structural changes.
    - Subgroup representation in the dataset matches deployment populations.
  - **Risks:**
    - Model accuracy declines if demographic or behavioral features shift significantly.
    - Underrepresented or small subgroups may exhibit higher error rates.
    - Outlier-heavy or skewed data distributions may cause instability.
  - **Lifecycle Mapping:**
    - **Data Ingestion & Cleaning:** Collect and preprocess raw datasets and address missingness.
    - **Feature Engineering & Modeling:** Build predictive models and evaluate with RMSE and R².
    - **Evaluation & Sensitivity Analysis:** Conduct scenario testing to assess robustness against variable perturbations.
    - **Deployment & Monitoring:** Implement monitoring for data drift, periodic retraining, and performance reassessment.
