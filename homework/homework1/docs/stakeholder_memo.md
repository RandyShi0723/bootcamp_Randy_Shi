Stakeholder Memo â€” ETF Strategy Viability

Audience: Portfolio Manager
Purpose:  Enable a decision with clear metrics and uncertainty bands.

#  Problem & Why It Matters
Should we keep allocating capital to the current ETF strategy over the next 12 months?  
We want to avoid drawdowns from a decaying edge while not abandoning a profitable signal.

#  Inputs & Assumptions
Point-in-time prices; realistic transaction costs.
No look-ahead bias; reproducible pipeline; benchmark fixed beforehand.

#  Risks
Alpha decay, mis-estimated costs, benchmark errors, overfitting.
